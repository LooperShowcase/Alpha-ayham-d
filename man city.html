      Manchester City Football Club are an English professional football club
      based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of
      English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became
      Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The
      club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester,
      to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.
      Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, in the first
      season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club
      has won nine league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA
      Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners'
      Cup, and one UEFA Super Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892,
      and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had
      its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
      winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup
      under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the
      1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline,
      culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the
      only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the
      top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League
      since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment
      both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh
      Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August
      2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club
      winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their
      first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the
      management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in
      2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100
      points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing
      an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the
      first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed
      by three consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, and
      2022–23, the third, fourth, and fifth in the Guardiola era, as well as the
      club's first-ever Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to
      Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European
      Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, a feat only
      achieved once before by an English men's team.[7] The club is ranked first
      in the UEFA coefficient standings as of 2023.[8] Manchester City topped
      the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season,
      making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world,
      approximated at €731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was
      the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11]
      Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a British-based
      holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and
      majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13]
